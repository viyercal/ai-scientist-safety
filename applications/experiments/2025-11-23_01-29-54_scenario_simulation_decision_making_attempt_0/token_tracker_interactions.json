We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2.

[{'authorId': '2257900930', 'name': 'Dong Chen'}, {'authorId': '2258533442', 'name': 'Yanbo Huang'}]. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 2024.\nAbstract: Efficient and sustainable crop production process management is crucial to meet the growing global demand for food, fuel, and feed while minimizing environmental impacts. Traditional crop management practices, often developed through empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the dynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as climate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring transformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn optimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across agricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This paper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop management decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in agricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms, their application within crop management, and the use of crop management simulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with crop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural practices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the uncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration also brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and enhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of crop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and innovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming agricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones.\n\n1: An Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism for Cloud AI Systems via Integration of Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multisource logs and system indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system recovery time by $37 \\%$ with unknown fault scenarios.\n\n2: Zero-shot Model-based Reinforcement Learning using Large Language Models.

Redko'}, {'authorId': '2256623448', 'name': \"Bal'azs K'egl\"}]. International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.\nAbstract: The emerging zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their applications in areas extending well beyond natural language processing tasks. In reinforcement learning, while LLMs have been extensively used in text-based environments, their integration with continuous state spaces remains understudied. In this paper, we investigate how pre-trained LLMs can be leveraged to predict in context the dynamics of continuous Markov decision processes. We identify handling multivariate data and incorporating the control signal as key challenges that limit the potential of LLMs' deployment in this setup and propose Disentangled In-Context Learning (DICL) to address them. We present proof-of-concept applications in two reinforcement learning settings: model-based policy evaluation and data-augmented off-policy reinforcement learning, supported by theoretical analysis of the proposed methods. Our experiments further demonstrate that our approach produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/dicl.\n\n3: A Technical Survey of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Large Language Models. [{'authorId': '2116934986', 'name': 'S.

This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally, it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms, and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions, including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and scalability.\n\n4: CAMEL: Continuous Action Masking Enabled by Large Language Models for Reinforcement Learning. [{'authorId': '2289871031', 'name': 'Yanxiao Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2290074667', 'name': 'Yangge Qian'}, {'authorId': '2289840678', 'name': 'Jingyang Shan'}, {'authorId': '2290239899', 'name': 'Xiaolin Qin'}]. arXiv.org, 2025.\nAbstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous action spaces encounters persistent challenges, such as inefficient exploration and convergence to suboptimal solutions. To address these limitations, we propose CAMEL, a novel framework integrating LLM-generated suboptimal policies into the RL training pipeline. CAMEL leverages dynamic action masking and an adaptive epsilon-masking mechanism to guide exploration during early training stages while gradually enabling agents to optimize policies independently. At the core of CAMEL lies the integration of Python-executable suboptimal policies generated by LLMs based on environment descriptions and task objectives. Although simplistic and hard-coded, these policies offer valuable initial guidance for RL agents. To effectively utilize these priors, CAMEL employs masking-aware optimization to dynamically constrain the action space based on LLM outputs. Additionally, epsilon-masking gradually reduces reliance on LLM-generated guidance, enabling agents to transition from constrained exploration to autonomous policy refinement. Experimental validation on Gymnasium MuJoCo environments demonstrates the effectiveness of CAMEL. In Hopper-v4 and Ant-v4, LLM-generated policies significantly improve sample efficiency, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing expert masking baselines. For Walker2d-v4, where LLMs struggle to accurately model bipedal gait dynamics, CAMEL maintains robust RL performance without notable degradation, highlighting the framework's adaptability across diverse tasks. While CAMEL shows promise in enhancing sample efficiency and mitigating convergence challenges, these issues remain open for further research. Future work aims to generalize CAMEL to multimodal LLMs for broader observation-action spaces and automate policy evaluation, reducing human intervention and enhancing scalability in RL training pipelines.\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, briefly reason over the search results and identify which citation(s) best fit your paper.\nIf none are appropriate or would contribute significantly to the write-up, add \"Do not add any\" to your thoughts.\nDo not select papers that are already in the `references.bib` file, or if the same citation exists under a different name.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with the following fields:\n- \"Selected\": A list of integer indices for the selected papers, for example [0, 1].

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop, interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.\n\n1: Behavior Generation for Heterogeneous Agents in Urban Simulation Deduction: A Multi-Stage Approach Based on Large Language Models.

The increasing demands for simulation deduction across large-scale scenarios and emergency situations highlight the need for rapid simulation scenario construction methods. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer powerful new tools to address these challenges. In this work, we propose LLM-HABG, a highly portable framework that can automatically generate behavior plans for heterogeneous agents in urban simulation environments based on natural language instructions, requiring no additional post-training. It comprises four stages: task extraction, task decomposition and allocation, urban information retrieval, and behavior generation. To overcome the limitations of LLMs, such as deficient instruction-following and hallucinations, we incorporate a suite of enhancement techniques including dynamic few-shot learning, entity alignment, and constrained decoding. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-HABG achieves robust performance even with 14B-parameter models, attaining a success rate exceeding 75 %-nearly doubling baseline performance. This conversational behavior configuration paradigm empowers domain experts to interact directly with simulation systems via natural language, significantly reducing the cost and barriers associated with simulation scenario construction.\n\n2: Arena 4.0: a Comprehensive Ros2 Development and Benchmarking Platform for Human-Centric Navigation Using Generative-Model-Based Environment Generation.

Novel Intelligent and Leading Emerging Sciences Conference, 2024.\nAbstract: In light of this complex information for programming environments, this paper explores how effectiveness in Large Language Models and concepts from Retrieval-Augmented Generation can be used to augment reduced hallucinated question-answering systems for programming environments. The present scenario of transformer-based models, though a big player in natural language processing, doesn't seem to have adaptability and context sensitivity, which is, in fact, a very important feature for a specialist domain. Our study, by integrating a sophisticated LLM model within the RAG framework, further improves the precision, effectiveness of retrieval, and sensitivity of the context of responses. The model based on LLM improves over this transformer-based model by scoring higher in accuracy and context awareness, supported by its pretraining on a massive corpus and dynamic document retrieval functionality. This result underlines the possibility of great improvement in QAS performance, handling very complex and specialized queries, through the integration of LLMs with the RAG systems, and thereby helps in indicating promising areas for further research in optimizing these methodologies across different domains.\n\n4: Evaluating Large Language Models in Class-Level Code Generation.

International Conference on Software Engineering, 2024.\nAbstract: Recently, many large language models (LLMs) have been proposed, showing advanced proficiency in code generation. Meanwhile, many efforts have been dedicated to evaluating LLMs on code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval. Although being very helpful for comparing different LLMs, existing evaluation focuses on a sim-ple code generation scenario (i.e., function-level or statement-level code generation), which mainly asks LLMs to generate one single code unit (e.g., a function or a statement) for the given natural language description. Such evaluation focuses on generating independent and often small-scale code units, thus leaving it unclear how LLMs perform in real-world software development scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap, we make the first attempt to evaluate LLMs in a more challenging code generation scenario, i.e., class-level code generation. Compared with existing code generation benchmarks, it better reflects real-world software development scenarios due to it comprising broader contextual dependencies and multiple, interdependent units of code. We first manually construct the first class-level code generation benchmark ClassEval of 100 class-level Python code generation tasks with approximately 500 person-hours. Based on the new benchmark ClassEval, we then perform the first study of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on class-level code generation. Based on our results, we find that all LLMs perform much worse on class-level code generation compared to the method-level. While GPT models still dominate other LLMs on class-level code generation, the performance rankings of other models on method-level code generation no longer holds for class-level code generation. Besides, most models (except GPT models) perform better when generating the class method by method; and they have the limited ability of generating dependent code. Based on our findings, we call for software engineering (SE) researchers' expertise to build more LLM benchmarks based on practical and complicated software development scenarios.\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, briefly reason over the search results and identify which citation(s) best fit your paper.\nIf none are appropriate or would contribute significantly to the write-up, add \"Do not add any\" to your thoughts.\nDo not select papers that are already in the `references.bib` file, or if the same citation exists under a different name.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with the following fields:\n- \"Selected\": A list of integer indices for the selected papers, for example [0, 1].
