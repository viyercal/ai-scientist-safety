% The paper 'Zero-shot Model-based Reinforcement Learning using Large Language Models' discusses the integration of LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL), especially in continuous state spaces. It addresses challenges and proposes solutions relevant to the proposed framework of using LLMs for scenario simulation in dynamic environments. This citation should be included in the related work section to support the integration of LLMs with RL in decision-making processes.

% The paper 'LinguaSim: Interactive Multi-Vehicle Testing Scenario Generation via Natural Language Instruction Based on Large Language Models' discusses the use of LLMs for generating realistic and interactive scenarios in dynamic environments. It addresses challenges in balancing realism with command adherence, which is relevant to our framework's focus on scenario generation and evaluation. This citation should be included in the related work section to support the discussion on scenario generation using LLMs.

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.
