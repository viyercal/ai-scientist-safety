    "Title": "Scenario Simulation for Enhanced Decision-Making in Dynamic Environments Using LLMs",
    "Short Hypothesis": "Can language models improve decision-making in dynamic environments by simulating potential future scenarios and evaluating their outcomes? We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.",
    "Related Work": "Existing works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.",
    "Abstract": "Dynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.",
    "Experiments": "1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.",
    "Risk Factors and Limitations": "Complexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability."
