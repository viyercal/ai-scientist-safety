  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Correct Metric Usage**: One of the key successes was the correction of metric usage during the validation phase. By focusing on Mean Squared Error without rounding, the experiments accurately captured the model's performance in regression tasks. This change led to improved validation metrics, highlighting the importance of using appropriate evaluation metrics for the task at hand.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, particularly for learning rates and epochs, proved successful. By evaluating multiple learning rates and epoch counts, the experiments identified optimal configurations that significantly reduced both training and validation losses. This highlights the importance of exploring a range of hyperparameters to enhance model performance.\n\n- **Device Management**: Ensuring that all relevant tensors were correctly moved to the appropriate device (CPU or GPU) was another successful strategy. This practice likely contributed to efficient computation and accurate results, emphasizing the importance of proper device management in experiments.\n\n- **Consistent Tracking and Saving of Results**: The experiments consistently tracked and saved results for comparison, which facilitated the identification of the best-performing configurations. This practice underscores the value of systematic result documentation for effective analysis and decision-making.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Inappropriate Metric Application**: Initially, there was a misapplication of metrics by rounding predictions in regression tasks, which led to inaccurate validation results. This highlights the pitfall of using inappropriate metrics for the task, which can mislead the evaluation of model performance.\n\n- **Lack of Comprehensive Hyperparameter Exploration**: While hyperparameter tuning was successful, there is a risk of not exploring a sufficiently wide range of hyperparameters, which could lead to suboptimal model performance. Ensuring a comprehensive exploration is crucial.\n\n- **Inadequate Device Management**: Although successful in the experiments, improper device management can lead to inefficient computation and errors. This is a common pitfall that should be continuously monitored.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Appropriate Metric Selection**: Always select evaluation metrics that align with the task's nature. For regression tasks, avoid rounding predictions and focus on metrics like Mean Squared Error or Mean Absolute Error.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue to explore a wide range of hyperparameters, including learning rates, epochs, batch sizes, and other relevant parameters. Use automated tools or frameworks for hyperparameter optimization to streamline this process.\n\n- **Maintain Rigorous Device Management**: Ensure that all computations are performed on the appropriate device (CPU or GPU) to optimize performance and avoid errors. Regularly review and update device management practices as needed.\n\n- **Implement Robust Result Tracking**: Continue to track and save experimental results systematically. Consider using version control systems or experiment tracking tools to manage and analyze results efficiently.\n\nBy adhering to these recommendations and learning from both successes and failures, future experiments can be more effectively designed and executed, leading to improved model performance and insights."
