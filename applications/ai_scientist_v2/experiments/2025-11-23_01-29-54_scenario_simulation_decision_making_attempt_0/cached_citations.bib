% The paper 'Zero-shot Model-based Reinforcement Learning using Large Language Models' discusses the integration of LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL), especially in continuous state spaces. It addresses challenges and proposes solutions relevant to the proposed framework of using LLMs for scenario simulation in dynamic environments. This citation should be included in the related work section to support the integration of LLMs with RL in decision-making processes.

% The paper 'LinguaSim: Interactive Multi-Vehicle Testing Scenario Generation via Natural Language Instruction Based on Large Language Models' discusses the use of LLMs for generating realistic and interactive scenarios in dynamic environments. It addresses challenges in balancing realism with command adherence, which is relevant to our framework's focus on scenario generation and evaluation. This citation should be included in the related work section to support the discussion on scenario generation using LLMs.
