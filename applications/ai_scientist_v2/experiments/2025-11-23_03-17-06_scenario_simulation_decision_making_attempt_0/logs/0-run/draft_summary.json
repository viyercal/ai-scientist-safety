  "Experiment_description": "The experiment implemented a feedforward neural network on a synthetic dataset to simulate a dynamic environment, aiming to improve scenario planning by predicting future states based on current conditions. It corrected a previous bug in the validation method.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for developing robust predictive models in dynamic environments, which have applications in fields such as autonomous systems and strategic decision-making. The findings highlight the model's potential to learn and generalize from complex scenarios, though attention to overfitting is necessary.",
  "Description": "The experiment involved creating a synthetic dataset for a dynamic environment, employing a feedforward neural network to predict future scenarios. Key aspects included fixing a bug in the validation method by using MSE without rounding predictions and ensuring correct tensor device allocation, thus improving evaluation robustness.",
