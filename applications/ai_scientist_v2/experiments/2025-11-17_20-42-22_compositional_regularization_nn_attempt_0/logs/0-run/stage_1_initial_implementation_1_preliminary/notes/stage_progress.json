Here's a comprehensive summary of the experimental progress based on the provided information:\n\n### Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\nUnfortunately, there are no successful experiments detailed in the provided information. Therefore, I cannot identify specific patterns of success. However, general successful patterns in neural network experiments typically include:\n- **Robust Data Handling:** Ensuring data is preprocessed and augmented correctly to improve model generalization.\n- **Effective Model Architecture:** Utilizing well-established architectures like ResNet18, which are known for their performance on image classification tasks.\n- **Proper Device Management:** Ensuring that computations are efficiently managed across available hardware (CPU/GPU).\n- **Clear Metric Tracking:** Implementing comprehensive logging and tracking of relevant metrics to monitor model performance over time.\n\n### Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n1. **Safety Policy Violations:**\n   - **Blocked Imports:** The repeated blocking of the 'os' module import due to safety policies indicates a need to adapt code to the constraints of the execution environment.\n   - **Blocked Functions:** The use of certain functions like 'model.eval()' was also restricted, suggesting the need for alternative approaches to model evaluation.\n\n2. **Improper Device Management:**\n   - Issues with moving tensors to the appropriate device (CPU/GPU) can lead to inefficient training and evaluation processes.\n\n3. **Inadequate Metric Tracking:**\n   - Failing to properly log and save metrics can hinder the ability to analyze and improve model performance over time.\n\n4. **Code Structure and Logic:**\n   - Errors in code logic, such as incorrect placement of model evaluation calls, can lead to execution failures and inaccurate results.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n1. **Adapt to Environment Constraints:**\n   - Avoid using restricted modules and functions. Explore alternative methods for directory management and model evaluation that comply with safety policies.\n\n2. **Enhance Code Robustness:**\n   - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to quickly identify and resolve issues.\n   - Ensure that all device management operations are correctly implemented to optimize computational efficiency.\n\n3. **Improve Metric Tracking:**\n   - Develop a robust system for logging and saving metrics that does not rely on restricted operations. Consider using built-in libraries or external services that comply with safety policies.\n\n4. **Refine Model Evaluation:**\n   - Investigate alternative methods for evaluating model performance without relying on restricted functions like 'model.eval()'. This might include using custom evaluation functions or leveraging available libraries that offer similar functionality.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**\n   - Conduct small-scale tests to validate changes before full-scale implementation. This will help identify potential issues early and reduce the impact of failures.\n\nBy addressing these common pitfalls and incorporating these recommendations, future experiments can be more successful and yield valuable insights into neural network performance and compositional generalization."
