  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Device Management**: Ensuring that model predictions are computed on the correct device is crucial for seamless execution and accurate results. This was a key fix in the successful experiments.\n\n- **Tracking Metrics**: Incorporating both training and validation metrics, such as SCS (Success Criterion Score) and loss, is essential for evaluating model performance comprehensively. The successful experiments consistently tracked these metrics.\n\n- **Data Normalization**: Normalizing input data significantly improved model performance. This step was explicitly handled in the successful experiments, leading to better results.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic tuning of hyperparameters, such as learning rate, was a successful strategy. The experiments demonstrated that a learning rate of 0.001 yielded the best performance, indicating the importance of fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal results.\n\n- **Experiment Structuring**: Organizing experiments with separate data structures for each configuration (e.g., different learning rates) allowed for clear analysis and comparison of results.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Validation Metrics**: Previous implementations that did not track validation metrics failed to provide a complete picture of model performance, leading to suboptimal results.\n\n- **Improper Data Handling**: Failing to store predictions and ground truth values properly can hinder analysis and understanding of model behavior.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Exploration**: The failed experiment with batch size tuning lacked error analysis, indicating a possible oversight in implementation or evaluation. This highlights the importance of thorough testing and analysis when exploring hyperparameters.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Comprehensive Device and Data Management**: Ensure that all computations are performed on the correct device and that data is normalized and handled properly throughout the process.\n\n- **Thorough Metric Tracking**: Always track both training and validation metrics to gain a complete understanding of model performance. This should include storing predictions and ground truth values for detailed analysis.\n\n- **Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue to explore hyperparameters systematically, but ensure thorough error analysis and debugging, especially when results are not as expected. This includes documenting any changes and their impacts meticulously.\n\n- **Structured Experimentation**: Maintain a structured approach to experimentation by organizing results and configurations clearly. This will facilitate easier comparison and analysis of different experimental setups.\n\n- **Error Analysis and Debugging**: Implement a robust error analysis framework to identify and address issues promptly. This is crucial for experiments that do not yield expected results, as seen in the batch size tuning experiment.\n\nBy adhering to these recommendations and learning from both successes and failures, future experiments can be more efficient and yield better insights into model performance and optimization."
