  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments demonstrated the importance of hyperparameter tuning, particularly for the learning rate. By experimenting with different learning rates (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1), the models achieved varying levels of training and validation success. The learning rate of 0.001 consistently resulted in higher training and validation SCS (Scenario Completion Score) but also higher losses, indicating a trade-off between learning rate and model performance.\n\n- **Experiment Data Structuring**: Organizing experiments into separate data structures for each hyperparameter setting allowed for clear tracking of metrics, losses, predictions, and ground truths. This structured approach facilitated a more systematic analysis of results and comparisons across different configurations.\n\n- **Seed Node Design**: Implementing a seed node design also showed promise, with the learning rate of 0.001 again yielding higher SCS values. This suggests that certain designs, when combined with appropriate hyperparameter settings, can enhance model performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Accessibility**: A major failure pattern was the use of non-existent or inaccessible datasets, leading to DatasetNotFoundError. This highlights the importance of verifying dataset availability and accessibility before execution.\n\n- **Undefined Functions**: Another common pitfall was the lack of implementation for expected functions, such as 'generate_data', resulting in NameError. This underscores the need for thorough code reviews to ensure all necessary components are defined and implemented.\n\n- **Overreliance on Placeholder Names**: Using placeholder names for datasets or functions without replacing them with actual, valid names led to execution failures. This indicates a need for careful attention to detail and thorough testing before deployment.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Search**: Future experiments should continue to explore a wide range of hyperparameters, including learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs, to identify optimal configurations. Implementing automated hyperparameter tuning tools could further enhance this process.\n\n- **Dataset Verification**: Before executing experiments, ensure all datasets are verified for existence and accessibility. Utilize tools or scripts to automatically check dataset availability on platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n- **Function Implementation and Testing**: Ensure all functions expected to be called during execution are properly implemented and tested. Conduct code reviews and use unit testing to catch undefined functions or errors early in the development process.\n\n- **Scenario Diversity Score (SDS) Integration**: Incorporate the computation of SDS to evaluate the model's ability to generate diverse scenarios. This can provide additional insights into model performance and generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Documentation and Code Clarity**: Maintain clear documentation and remove extraneous comments to improve code readability and maintainability. This will aid in debugging and future development efforts.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successes and failures, future experiments can be more robust, efficient, and insightful."
