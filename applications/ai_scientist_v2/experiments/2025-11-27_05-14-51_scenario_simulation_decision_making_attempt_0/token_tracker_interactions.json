We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2024.\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks via popular Chains-of-Thought (COT) prompting. However, such a simple and fast COT approach often encounters limitations in dealing with complicated problems, while a thorough method, which considers multiple reasoning pathways and verifies each step carefully, results in slower inference. This paper addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to autonomously select between fast and slow inference methods, thereby optimizing both efficiency and effectiveness. We introduce a dynamic decision-making framework that categorizes tasks into two distinct pathways: \u2018Fast,\u2019 designated for tasks where the LLM quickly identifies a high-confidence solution, and \u2018Slow,\u2019 allocated for tasks that the LLM perceives as complex and for which it has low confidence in immediate solutions as well as requiring more reasoning paths to verify. Experiments on five popular reasoning benchmarks demonstrated the superiority of the DynaThink over baselines. For example, when we compared it to strong COT with self-consistency baseline on the complicated MATH dataset, DynaThink achieved more than 3% increase in accuracy with lower cost. The code will be made available upon publication.\n\n1: Integrating human expertise & automated methods for a dynamic and multi-parametric evaluation of large language models' feasibility in clinical decision-making.

[{'authorId': '80217322', 'name': 'Berdymyrat Ovezmyradov'}]. arXiv.org, 2025.\nAbstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term decision-making.\n\n3: SafeDrive: Knowledge- and Data-Driven Risk-Sensitive Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Models.

Accident Analysis and Prevention, 2024.\nAbstract: Recent advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well in normal driving scenarios. However, ensuring safety in dynamic, high-risk environments and managing safety-critical long-tail events remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose SafeDrive, a knowledge- and data-driven risk-sensitive decision-making framework, to enhance AV safety and adaptability. The proposed framework introduces a modular system comprising: (1) a Risk Module for comprehensive quantification of multi-factor coupled risks involving driver, vehicle, and road interactions; (2) a Memory Module for storing and retrieving typical scenarios to improve adaptability; (3) a LLM-powered Reasoning Module for context-aware safety decision-making; and (4) a Reflection Module for refining decisions through iterative learning. By integrating knowledge-driven insights with adaptive learning mechanisms, the framework ensures robust decision-making under uncertain conditions. Extensive evaluations on real-world traffic datasets characterized by dynamic and high-risk scenarios, including highways (HighD), intersections (InD), and roundabouts (RounD), validate the framework's ability to enhance decision-making safety (achieving a 100% safety rate), replicate human-like driving behaviors (with decision alignment exceeding 85%), and adapt effectively to unpredictable scenarios. The proposed framework of SafeDrive establishes a novel paradigm for integrating knowledge- and data-driven methods, highlighting significant potential to improve the safety and adaptability of autonomous driving in long-tail or high-risk traffic scenarios.

Pribylskii'}, {'authorId': '2315021922', 'name': 'D. Armeev'}]. 2024 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Problems of Informatics, Electronics and Radio Engineering (PIERE), 2024.\nAbstract: Managing large power systems involves complex tasks traditionally handled by human operators. The emergence of Smart Grids, integrating small distributed power generation, has further complicated grid management due to increased structural complexity and the involvement of unqualified stakeholders. In response to these challenges, there is growing interest in utilizing artificial intelligence to assist or replace human operators. However, existing artificial intelligence systems are often scenario-specific and lack the adaptability needed for dynamic grid configurations. This article introduces an innovative AI-based control system that leverages natural language processing capabilities of large language models. By analyzing grid states and user instructions provided in natural language, the AI generates adaptive control actions to maintain grid stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the system's effectiveness in handling various load scenarios, including both gradual and abrupt changes. The artificial intelligence-based control system successfully performs actions akin to those of a human operator, such as activating additional generation or disconnecting loads to stabilize the grid. The system's flexibility allows it to incorporate user commands and adapt to specific conditions, ensuring precise and dynamic control actions.\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, briefly reason over the search results and identify which citation(s) best fit your paper.\nIf none are appropriate or would contribute significantly to the write-up, add \"Do not add any\" to your thoughts.\nDo not select papers that are already in the `references.bib` file, or if the same citation exists under a different name.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with the following fields:\n- \"Selected\": A list of integer indices for the selected papers, for example [0, 1].

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

In this context, we investigate the potential of leveraging the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to create knowledge representations for supporting operations research. By adopting ChatGPT-4 API as the reasoning core, we outline an applied workflow that encompasses natural language processing, Methontology-based prompt tuning, and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), to automate the construction of scenario-based ontologies using existing research articles and technical manuals of urban datasets and simulations. From these ontologies, knowledge graphs can be derived using widely adopted formats and protocols, guiding various tasks towards data-informed decision support. The performance of our methodology is evaluated through a comparative analysis that contrasts our AI-generated ontology with the widely recognized pizza ontology, commonly used in tutorials for popular ontology software. We conclude with a real-world case study on optimizing the complex system of multi-modal freight transportation. Our approach advances urban decision support systems by enhancing data and metadata modeling, improving data integration and simulation coupling, and guiding the development of decision support strategies and essential software components.\n\n1: Towards Intelligent Emergency Management: A Scenario\u2013Learning\u2013Decision Framework Enabled by Large Language Models.

In this context,\"representation\"is the activity of making an individual's preferences present in the process via participation by a proxy agent -- i.e. their\"representative\". To this end, learned models of human behavior have the potential to fill this role, with practical implications for multi-agent scenario studies and mechanism design. In this work, we investigate the possibility of training \\textit{language agents} to behave in the capacity of representatives of human agents, appropriately expressing the preferences of those individuals whom they stand for. First, we formalize the setting of \\textit{collective decision-making} -- as the episodic process of interaction between a group of agents and a decision mechanism. On this basis, we then formalize the problem of \\textit{digital representation} -- as the simulation of an agent's behavior to yield equivalent outcomes from the mechanism. Finally, we conduct an empirical case study in the setting of \\textit{consensus-finding} among diverse humans, and demonstrate the feasibility of fine-tuning large language models to act as digital representatives.\n\n3: A Digitalized Business Wargame Model for Foresight-based Future Planning and Decision-Making.

However, decision-makers have difficulties in directly using these complex models. Water managers are primarily interested in user-friendly features allowing an integration of their judgments into the decision-making process, rather than applying detailed theories and methodologies. This knowledge gap between technical simulation models and policy-makers highlights the urgent need for developing an integrated water resource management decision support system (IWRM-DSS). This paper describes the main aspects of a new IWRM-DSS in which Microsoft Visual Studio under the C# language was employed to integrate the Microsoft SQL server as a database and ArcGIS Engine DLLs for pre/postdata processing for the SWAT and MODFLOW models. Two particular \u2018module\u2019 and \u2018presentation\u2019 shells are specifically designed for decision-makers to create four different scenarios, namely, \u2018climatic\u2019, \u2018recharge\u2019, \u2018discharge\u2019, and \u2018coupled\u2019 and to analyze the results. Decision-makers, without any detailed modeling knowledge and computer skills, can access the data and run models to test different management scenarios in an attractive graphical user interface. The IWRM-DSS, which was applied for the Neishaboor watershed, Iran, reveals that mean annual potential evapotranspiration increased to 8.2%, while runoff and recharge rates are reduced to 35 and 63%, which led to a decline of 13.5 m in mean groundwater level for the 13-year projected period.\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, briefly reason over the search results and identify which citation(s) best fit your paper.\nIf none are appropriate or would contribute significantly to the write-up, add \"Do not add any\" to your thoughts.\nDo not select papers that are already in the `references.bib` file, or if the same citation exists under a different name.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with the following fields:\n- \"Selected\": A list of integer indices for the selected papers, for example [0, 1].

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

MELODI enables detailed observations of power consumption dynamics and facilitates the creation of a comprehensive dataset reflective of energy efficiency across varied deployment scenarios. The dataset, generated using MELODI, encompasses a broad spectrum of LLM deployment frameworks, multiple language models, and extensive prompt datasets, enabling a comparative analysis of energy use. Using the dataset, we investigate how prompt attributes, including length and complexity, correlate with energy expenditure. Our findings indicate substantial disparities in energy efficiency, suggesting ample scope for optimization and adoption of sustainable measures in LLM deployment. Our contribution lies not only in the MELODI framework but also in the novel dataset, a resource that can be expanded by other researchers.

Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2024.\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in handling long-context tasks because of their limited effective context window size during pretraining, which restricts their ability to generalize over extended sequences. Meanwhile, extending the context window in LLMs through post-pretraining is highly resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce LongRecipe, an efficient training strategy for extending the context window of LLMs, including impactful token analysis, position index transformation, and training optimization strategies. It simulates long-sequence inputs while maintaining training efficiency and significantly improves the model's understanding of long-range dependencies. Experiments on three types of LLMs show that LongRecipe can utilize long sequences while requiring only 30% of the target context window size, and reduces computational training resource over 85% compared to full sequence training. Furthermore, LongRecipe also preserves the original LLM's capabilities in general tasks. Ultimately, we can extend the effective context window of open-source LLMs from 8k to 128k, achieving performance close to GPT-4 with just one day of dedicated training using a single GPU with 80G memory.

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

[{'authorId': '152425748', 'name': 'Wenhao Ding'}]. arXiv.org, 2023.\nAbstract: Autonomous systems, such as self-driving vehicles, quadrupeds, and robot manipulators, are largely enabled by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. However, such systems involve several trustworthy challenges such as safety, robustness, and generalization, due to their deployment in open-ended and real-time environments. To evaluate and improve trustworthiness, simulations or so-called digital twins are largely utilized for system development with low cost and high efficiency. One important thing in virtual simulations is scenarios that consist of static and dynamic objects, specific tasks, and evaluation metrics. However, designing diverse, realistic, and effective scenarios is still a challenging problem. One straightforward way is creating scenarios through human design, which is time-consuming and limited by the experience of experts. Another method commonly used in self-driving areas is log replay. This method collects scenario data in the real world and then replays it in simulations or adds random perturbations. Although the replay scenarios are realistic, most of the collected scenarios are redundant since they are all ordinary scenarios that only consider a small portion of critical cases. The desired scenarios should cover all cases in the real world, especially rare but critical events with extremely low probability. Critical scenarios are rare but important to test autonomous systems under risky conditions and unpredictable perturbations, which reveal their trustworthiness.\n\n1: Performance Evaluation of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks Considering Malicious Node Impact on Quality of Services Metrics.

Jurnal Online Informatika, 2025.\nAbstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), a subset of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), is essential for enabling communication between vehicles in intelligent transportation systems. However, their dynamic and decentralized nature exposes them to significant security threats, particularly from malicious nodes. Attacks such as black holes and wormholes can severely degrade network performance by causing packet loss and increasing end-to-end delays. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of malicious node behavior on VANET performance using key Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, including throughput, end-to-end delay, jitter, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and packet loss ratio (PLR). The specific objective is to analyze how black hole and wormhole attacks affect communication efficiency in VANET environments. The main contribution of this work lies in the integration of Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) for realistic traffic scenario generation with Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) for detailed network performance evaluation. This approach enables comprehensive simulation of VANET behavior under attack conditions. The findings provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of VANETs and form a basis for the design of more robust and secure vehicular communication systems.\n\n2: Crafting animated parables: an embodied approach to representing lifestyle behaviours for reflection. [{'authorId': '153832160', 'name': 'Kenny K. N. Chow'}]. Digital Creativity, 2020.\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Latest work regarding personal informatics, gamification, and feedback has suggested that visualizing behavioural data for daily reflection should consider dynamic representations in metaphors and narratives with positively and negatively valued outcomes. Grounded in behavioural models from social psychology and embodied cognition theories, this article proposes a framework guiding the generation of animated parables wherein causality between a behaviour and its virtual outcomes is easy to understand. The guidelines include metaphorical mapping and blending the behaviour with a direct cause-effect scenario with similarities in embodied experiences. Application of the guidelines in a series of design workshops generates 47 parables. To evaluate the parables, metrics include naturalness of integrating with life routines, aesthetics of blending into environments, and ease of interpreting the causality. Evaluation results show that more embodied mapping and blending are more likely to result in understandable behaviour-outcome links. Designers can follow the guidelines and metrics to generate and compare ideas. Lastly, recommendations for crafting more embodied parables are provided.\n\n3: SNGNN2D-v2: A GNN-Based Model for the Generation of Human-Aware Cost Maps in Dynamic Environments.

Calderita'}, {'authorId': '2334289146', 'name': 'Luis J. Manso'}]. International Journal of Social Robotics, 2024.\nAbstract: Navigating dynamic, human-populated environments is a critical challenge for mobile robots, as they must balance effective pathfinding with minimizing social disruption. Cost maps can combine information from different nature and are more interpretable than final control signals. This paper addresses the generation of real-time cost maps in human-aware navigation (HAN) by introducing SNGNN2D-v2, a graph neural network designed and trained to capture social interactions and respond to dynamic elements in human-populated environments. SNGNN2D-v2 is evaluated through three types of experiments. The first involves deploying a real robot in a controlled indoor environment and assessing the disturbance caused by the robot when driven by the model. The second experiment tests the proposed model under more complex and unfavorable conditions using simulated environments. Both experiments include a comparison with other proposals using social and navigation metrics. The third experiment compares SNGNN2D-v2 with an end-to-end CNN-based method to evaluate how models generalize across changes in the appearance of the environment and its elements. The results from these experiments suggest that SNGNN2D-v2 is an effective model for human-aware cost map generation for dynamic environments. Its ability to capture dynamic information, generalize across scenarios with different appearances, and represent social interactions could contribute to the development of human-friendly robots.\n\n\n4: Efficient Generation of Safety-Critical Scenarios Combining Dynamic and Static Scenario Parameters.

IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 2024.\nAbstract: Due to the rarity of safety-critical scenarios, the safety of autonomous driving decision-making algorithms cannot be fully guaranteed in open environments, which limits their further applications. Therefore, it is crucial to efficiently generate such scenarios for the safety validation of autonomous driving algorithms. This paper proposes an efficient safety-critical scenario generation method combining dynamic and static parameters that constitute a scenario by alternating the optimization of them. To generate dynamic scenario parameters efficiently, a traffic participants model integrating reinforcement learning and prior traffic knowledge is proposed, which is then optimized under the guidance of a prior risk estimation model. For the generation of static scenario parameters, a posterior risk estimation model is proposed, which learns from the explored parameter trajectories during the dynamic scenario generation, to estimate the risk of unknown states. Finally, three different efficiency metrics are proposed and experiments are conducted on rule-based, optimization-based, and learning-based autonomous driving algorithms to verify the high efficiency and generality of the proposed method. Compared with the baseline model that only considers dynamic parameters, the proposed method averagely improves the generation speed by 151.8% and the success rate by 78.7% with only a few alternate optimizations. In addition, the method is generalizable for different types of autonomous driving algorithms. The safety-critical scenario generation paradigm proposed in this paper can greatly accelerate the safety evaluation for any given algorithm, which is of great significance for the development of autonomous driving.\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, briefly reason over the search results and identify which citation(s) best fit your paper.\nIf none are appropriate or would contribute significantly to the write-up, add \"Do not add any\" to your thoughts.\nDo not select papers that are already in the `references.bib` file, or if the same citation exists under a different name.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with the following fields:\n- \"Selected\": A list of integer indices for the selected papers, for example [0, 1].

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nWe have the following experiment summaries (JSON):\n```json\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\nThe ability to make informed decisions in dynamic environments is crucial for many real-world applications, from autonomous driving to financial trading. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods excel at maximizing immediate rewards but often fall short in environments where future states are uncertain and long-term planning is essential. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate potential future scenarios, integrating these insights with RL systems to enhance decision-making. This approach aims to provide foresight advantages by evaluating multiple plausible futures, selecting actions that align with both immediate and long-term objectives. Our contributions include developing a framework for scenario simulation and evaluating its efficacy in dynamic environments.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related}\nPrevious research has explored the use of LLMs in decision-making tasks, primarily focusing on static environments or immediate reward scenarios \\citep{pan2024dynathinkfo, wang2025towardsie}. Our work distinguishes itself by applying LLMs to dynamic environments, where the ability to anticipate and simulate future scenarios can significantly enhance decision-making. Existing RL frameworks typically prioritize immediate rewards \\citep{sutton2018reinforcementl}, whereas our approach integrates LLM-generated scenarios to address long-term planning. The challenges of scenario evaluation and computational overhead are highlighted in works such as \\citep{ding2023criticalsg, yang2024hadesha}.\n\n\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\nOur proposed framework involves two key components: scenario generation and integration with RL. LLMs are trained to generate diverse and plausible future scenarios based on current states and actions. These scenarios are then evaluated to assess their potential outcomes and alignment with long-term goals. The RL system uses these evaluations to inform its decision-making process, selecting actions that maximize both immediate and long-term rewards. This method aims to improve policy robustness and adaptability in environments characterized by high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\nWe conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a synthetic dataset, we implemented scenario simulation and integrated it with an RL environment. Metrics such as training and validation loss, along with the Scenario Outcome Robustness Score (SORS), were used to assess performance. Results indicated moderate success, with improvements in decision-making and scenario evaluation, though challenges remain in scenario plausibility and computational efficiency. Our experiments highlighted the potential for LLMs to enhance RL, but also underscored the need for further refinement and tuning.\n\n\\begin{table}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Metrics from experiments on the synthetic dataset.

Future work will focus on improving scenario realism and efficiency, as well as testing in more complex real-world settings.

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nWe have the following experiment summaries (JSON):\n```json\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This paper introduces a novel framework where large language models (LLMs) simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process.

Traditional RL methods have primarily focused on optimizing immediate rewards, often neglecting the potential benefits of considering future scenarios. This paper explores the integration of LLMs with RL to simulate and evaluate potential future scenarios, aiming to enhance decision-making processes. Our contributions include the development of a scenario-simulation framework that leverages LLMs to generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, thus providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related}\nPrevious research has explored the application of LLMs in decision-making tasks, predominantly in static environments \\cite{wang2025towardsie,pan2024dynathinkfo}. However, their potential in dynamic settings remains underexplored. Existing works focus on immediate reward maximization using RL \\cite{sutton2018reinforcementl}. Our approach distinguishes itself by utilizing the generative capabilities of LLMs to simulate future scenarios, potentially improving decision-making in uncertain environments. The computational overhead associated with LLMs is a noted challenge, as discussed in \\cite{yang2024hadesha}.\n\n\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\nOur framework integrates LLMs with RL by utilizing LLMs to generate potential future scenarios based on the current state and action space. These scenarios are then evaluated to determine their plausibility and potential outcomes, which guide the decision-making process. The Scenario Outcome Robustness Score (SORS) is used as a metric to evaluate how well the chosen actions align with long-term goals. This framework aims to balance immediate reward optimization with long-term scenario implications.\n\n\\section{Experimental Setup}\n\\label{sec:experimental_setup}\nExperiments were conducted using a synthetic dataset to test the scenario simulation framework. A simple neural network was employed to estimate future outcomes based on current states and actions. The framework was tested for its ability to generate diverse and plausible scenarios, which were evaluated using SORS. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize model performance, particularly focusing on batch size variations.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\nThe experiments aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing decision-making in dynamic environments. The baseline model demonstrated a training loss of 8.8891 and a validation loss of 8.4361, with a SORS value of 2.4667. Subsequent hyperparameter tuning revealed a decrease in training and validation losses to 6.4958 and 6.2429, respectively, with consistent SORS values. These results suggest potential improvements in decision-making capabilities, although challenges such as overfitting and data diversity were observed.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{example-image-a}\n\\caption{Training and validation loss curves indicating model performance over epochs.}\n\\label{fig:loss_curves}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\nThis study introduces a framework that integrates LLMs with RL to simulate and evaluate potential future scenarios, enhancing decision-making in dynamic environments.

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nWe have the following experiment summaries (JSON):\n```json\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"We will create a simple scenario simulation to enhance decision-making using a synthetic dataset.

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This paper introduces a novel framework where large language models (LLMs) simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\nIn dynamic environments, the ability to anticipate and adapt to future states is crucial for effective decision-making. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) techniques excel at optimizing for immediate rewards but often fall short in navigating the long-term implications of decisions. This paper explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) within RL frameworks to simulate potential future scenarios, thereby enhancing the decision-making process. The hypothesis posited is that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, thus providing a foresight advantage that improves policy robustness and generalizability in uncertain and dynamic environments.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related}\nExisting literature has primarily focused on the application of LLMs in static decision-making tasks \\citep{pan2024dynathinkfo}, with limited exploration of their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Prior research has mainly concentrated on the immediate reward maximization aspect of RL \\citep{sutton2018reinforcementl}. Our work is distinct in its application of LLMs for scenario simulation, drawing on related efforts in emergency management and dynamic decision-making \\citep{wang2025towardsie}. The computational overhead associated with LLMs, as discussed by \\citet{yang2024hadesha}, also presents a significant challenge in real-time applications.\n\n\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\nThe proposed framework employs LLMs to simulate a range of potential future scenarios based on current states and actions. These scenarios are evaluated to determine their plausibility and potential outcomes, aiding in decision-making that aligns with long-term goals. The integration involves using the generative capabilities of LLMs to provide foresight, enhancing RL systems' adaptability and robustness. A key challenge is ensuring the relevance and quality of generated scenarios, as emphasized by \\citet{ding2023criticalsg}.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\nThe experimental setup involves three main components: scenario generation and evaluation, integration with standard RL environments, and testing the system's robustness. We utilize a synthetic dataset to simulate dynamic environments and measure performance using the Scenario Outcome Robustness Score (SORS). Initial experiments show a convergence in both training and validation metrics, indicating effective learning. However, the results also highlight potential issues with overfitting and instability, suggesting the need for further tuning and exploration of diverse datasets.\n\n% Example Figure\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{example-image-a}\n\\caption{Convergence of training and validation metrics over epochs indicating effective learning.}\n\\label{fig:first_figure}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\nThis study presents a novel approach to enhancing decision-making in dynamic environments by integrating LLM-generated scenario simulations with RL frameworks. While initial results are promising, challenges such as computational overhead and scenario evaluation complexity remain. Future work will focus on optimizing these aspects and further validating the framework in real-world applications to ensure its practical applicability and generalizability.\n\n\\bibliography{references}\n\\bibliographystyle{iclr2025}\n\n\\appendix\n\n\\section*{\\LARGE Supplementary Material}\n\\label{sec:appendix}\n\n\\section{Appendix Section}\nFurther details regarding the experimental setup, including hyperparameters and additional plots, are provided in this supplementary section to support the findings discussed in the main text.\n\n\\end{document}\n```", "timestamp": 1764222797}]}
