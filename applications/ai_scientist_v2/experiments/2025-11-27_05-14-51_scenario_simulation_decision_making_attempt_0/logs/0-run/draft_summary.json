  "Experiment_description": "The experiment involves setting up a simulation environment using a synthetic dataset to improve decision-making. A neural network model is trained to evaluate the Scenario Outcome Robustness Score (SORS), which measures the effectiveness of actions in achieving long-term goals.",
  "Significance": "These foundational experiments are important as they establish a baseline for using neural networks in decision-making simulations. The findings suggest that the model can generalize well, providing a solid basis for further exploration and refinement in achieving robust scenario outcomes.",
  "Description": "The process begins with the creation of a synthetic dataset, followed by the setup of a basic neural network model. The model is trained to minimize loss and optimize the Scenario Outcome Robustness Score (SORS), a metric evaluating the alignment of actions with desired outcomes. Training and validation metrics are monitored for improvements, indicating model optimization and robustness.",
