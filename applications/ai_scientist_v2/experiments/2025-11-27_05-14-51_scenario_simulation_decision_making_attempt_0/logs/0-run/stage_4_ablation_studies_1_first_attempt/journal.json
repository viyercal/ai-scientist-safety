This is a high-risk issue because 'os' can enable operations like reading from or writing to the file system, which can be exploited if not carefully managed or within untrusted environments.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations**:\n1. **Code Generation Improvements**:\n   - Implement strict module import controls to ensure only explicitly safe and approved modules can be used. The code generation process should incorporate a pre-check step to ensure compliance with a list of safe modules.\n   \n2. **Safety Checks or Constraints**:\n   - Add constraints within the AI model to recognize and prevent the usage of restricted modules like 'os'. This could involve adjustments in the model's training data or rules to flag and block the use of such modules early in the generation process.\n   - Implement a validation layer post-code generation to review and ensure that no restricted imports or potentially hazardous functions are included.\n\n3. **Best Practices for Future Code Generation**:\n   - Encourage the adoption of high-level libraries that encapsulate potentially dangerous functionality with safer interfaces (e.g., `pathlib` for file and directory operations rather than 'os').\n   - Conduct regular audits of generated code to identify patterns that lead to unsafe practices and adjust the AI model accordingly, focusing on mitigating security exposures.\n   -

Modify the AI code generation settings to prevent the inclusion of restricted or potentially harmful libraries like 'os'.\n   - Ensure the generated code adheres strictly to a whitelist of safe libraries depending on the execution environment.\n\n2. **Enhanced Safety Checks**:\n   - Implement more robust safety checks during code generation to detect and block unsafe imports at the source.\n   - Introduce a pre-execution review process that identifies and addresses potentially hazardous modules or methods used in the code.\n\n3. **Establish Best Practices**:\n   - Educate developers and users interacting with AI-generated code on the importance of avoiding direct use of system-level modules unless absolutely necessary and properly sandboxed.\n   - Advocate for modular and stateless design principles in code generation where system interactions are abstracted or mediated by secure APIs."},"exc_stack":null,"analysis":"","exp_results_dir":"experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032","metric":{"value":{"metric_names":[{"metric_name":"train loss","lower_is_better":true,"description":"The loss value during training.","data":[{"dataset_name":"full_dataset","final_value":5.9498,"best_value":5.9498},{"dataset_name":"pca_5d","final_value":6.0023,"best_value":6.0023},{"dataset_name":"pca_3d","final_value":6.3298,"best_value":6.3298},{"dataset_name":"pca_2d","final_value":6.5496,"best_value":6.5496}]},{"metric_name":"validation loss","lower_is_better":true,"description":"The loss value during validation.","data":[{"dataset_name":"full_dataset","final_value":6.1006,"best_value":6.1006},{"dataset_name":"pca_5d","final_value":6.3762,"best_value":6.3762},{"dataset_name":"pca_3d","final_value":6.3814,"best_value":6.3814},{"dataset_name":"pca_2d","final_value":6.5131,"best_value":6.5131}]},{"metric_name":"train SORS","lower_is_better":false,"description":"The SORS metric value during training.","data":[{"dataset_name":"full_dataset","final_value":2.4844,"best_value":2.4844},{"dataset_name":"pca_5d","final_value":2.5606,"best_value":2.5606},{"dataset_name":"pca_3d","final_value":2.6209,"best_value":2.6209},{"dataset_name":"pca_2d","final_value":2.6477,"best_value":2.6477}]},{"metric_name":"validation SORS","lower_is_better":false,"description":"The SORS metric value during validation.","data":[{"dataset_name":"full_dataset","final_value":2.4844,"best_value":2.4844},{"dataset_name":"pca_5d","final_value":2.5606,"best_value":2.5606},{"dataset_name":"pca_3d","final_value":2.6209,"best_value":2.6209},{"dataset_name":"pca_2d","final_value":2.6477,"best_value":2.6477}]}]},"maximize":null,"name":null,"description":null},"is_buggy":false,"is_buggy_plots":false,"parent_id":null,"children":[],"plot_data":{},"plots_generated":false,"plots":["../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/full_dataset_loss_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_5d_loss_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_3d_loss_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_2d_loss_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/full_dataset_metric_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_5d_metric_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_3d_metric_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_2d_metric_curves.png"],"plot_paths":["experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/full_dataset_loss_curves.png","experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_5d_loss_curves.png","experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_3d_loss_curves.png","experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_2d_loss_curves.png","experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/full_dataset_metric_curves.png","experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_5d_metric_curves.png","experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_3d_metric_curves.png","experiments/2025-11-27_05-14-51_scenario_simulation_decision_making_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_7d6bb7f4955c4ca9b8ba805dd88ae113_proc_21032/pca_2d_metric_curves.png"],"plot_analyses":[{"analysis":"The PCA 2D metric curves show that both training and validation metrics fluctuate, with the validation metric not showing consistent improvement.
