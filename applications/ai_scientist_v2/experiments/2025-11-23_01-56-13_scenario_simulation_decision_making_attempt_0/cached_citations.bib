% The paper 'Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Environments' by Zhi Wang et al. discusses a method for adapting reinforcement learning strategies in dynamic environments. This work is relevant to the proposed framework as it provides insights into how RL can be adapted to changing environments, which is a critical aspect of integrating LLMs for scenario simulation in decision-making. The paper should be cited when discussing the challenges of RL in dynamic environments and the importance of adaptability and robustness in the proposed framework.

% The paper 'SafeDrive: Knowledge- and Data-Driven Risk-Sensitive Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Models' by Zhiyuan Zhou et al. explores using LLMs to enhance decision-making in dynamic, high-risk environments, specifically for autonomous vehicles. This work is relevant when discussing the application of LLMs in dynamic scenarios, supporting our hypothesis that LLMs can simulate future scenarios to improve decision-making. It should be cited in sections summarizing existing research and supporting arguments for LLM applications in dynamic environments.
