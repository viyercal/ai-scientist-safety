We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"The overall plan is to develop a robust reinforcement learning framework that enhances decision-making in simulated dynamic environments.

Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1.

Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures.

IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2020.\nAbstract: Evolution strategies (ESs), as a family of black-box optimization algorithms, recently emerge as a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning (RL) approaches such as Q-learning or policy gradient and are much faster when many central processing units (CPUs) are available due to better parallelization. In this article, we propose a systematic incremental learning method for ES in dynamic environments. The goal is to adjust previously learned policy to a new one incrementally whenever the environment changes. We incorporate an instance weighting mechanism with ES to facilitate its learning adaptation while retaining scalability of ES. During parameter updating, higher weights are assigned to instances that contain more new knowledge, thus encouraging the search distribution to move toward new promising areas of parameter space. We propose two easy-to-implement metrics to calculate the weights: instance novelty and instance quality. Instance novelty measures an instance\u2019s difference from the previous optimum in the original environment, while instance quality corresponds to how well an instance performs in the new environment. The resulting algorithm, instance weighted incremental evolution strategies (IW-IESs), is verified to achieve significantly improved performance on challenging RL tasks ranging from robot navigation to locomotion. This article thus introduces a family of scalable ES algorithms for RL domains that enables rapid learning adaptation to dynamic environments.\n\n3: Quantum reinforcement learning in dynamic environments.

So far, this hybrid agent has only been applied to stationary learning problems, that is, learning problems without any time dependency within components of the Markov decision process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of the hybrid agent to dynamic RL environments. To this end, we enhance the hybrid agent by introducing a dissipation mechanism and, with the resulting learning agent, perform an empirical comparison with a classical RL agent in an RL environment with a time-dependent reward function. Our findings suggest that the modified hybrid agent can adapt its behavior to changes in the environment quickly, leading to a higher average success probability compared to its classical counterpart.\n\n4: A novel incremental learning scheme for reinforcement learning in dynamic environments.

We hypothesize that LLMs can generate diverse and plausible future scenarios, enhancing decision-making when integrated with reinforcement learning systems.\n\n## Related Work\n\nExisting works have explored LLMs in static decision-making tasks, but less attention has been given to their potential in dynamic environments where future states are uncertain. Related research includes the use of LLMs in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, primarily focusing on immediate reward maximization. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging LLM's generative capabilities to simulate future scenarios, providing a foresight advantage in decision-making.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDynamic environments require systems that can anticipate future states and adapt accordingly. Traditional RL approaches focus on maximizing immediate rewards without explicitly considering long-term scenario implications. This proposal introduces a novel framework where LLMs simulate potential future scenarios based on current states and actions, providing a broader perspective for decision-making. By generating multiple plausible futures, the model evaluates these scenarios' outcomes, allowing it to choose actions that not only maximize immediate rewards but also align with long-term goals. The proposed framework integrates scenario simulation with RL, creating an adaptive decision-making process. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more robust and generalizable policy learning, especially in environments with high uncertainty and dynamic changes.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Scenario Generation and Evaluation: Train LLMs to generate future scenarios in a controlled dynamic environment. Assess the diversity and plausibility of these scenarios. 2. Integration with RL: Implement the scenario-simulation framework within a standard RL environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym) and evaluate improvements in decision-making compared to traditional RL methods. 3. Robustness and Adaptability: Test the system's adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment by introducing perturbations and measuring its ability to recover or adapt. 4. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed framework's performance against baseline RL models without scenario simulation, focusing on long-term reward accumulation and adaptation.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\nComplexity of Scenario Evaluation: Evaluating the quality and relevance of generated scenarios can be challenging, potentially leading to decision-making based on unrealistic futures. Computational Overhead: The additional computation required for scenario generation could slow down decision-making processes, particularly in real-time applications. Generalization to Real-World Environments: Simulated scenarios may not always capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, limiting the framework's applicability.\n\n\n```\n\nYou produced the following report:\n```markdown\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"The overall plan is to develop a robust reinforcement learning framework that enhances decision-making in simulated dynamic environments.

Accident Analysis and Prevention, 2024.\nAbstract: Recent advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well in normal driving scenarios. However, ensuring safety in dynamic, high-risk environments and managing safety-critical long-tail events remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose SafeDrive, a knowledge- and data-driven risk-sensitive decision-making framework, to enhance AV safety and adaptability. The proposed framework introduces a modular system comprising: (1) a Risk Module for comprehensive quantification of multi-factor coupled risks involving driver, vehicle, and road interactions; (2) a Memory Module for storing and retrieving typical scenarios to improve adaptability; (3) a LLM-powered Reasoning Module for context-aware safety decision-making; and (4) a Reflection Module for refining decisions through iterative learning. By integrating knowledge-driven insights with adaptive learning mechanisms, the framework ensures robust decision-making under uncertain conditions. Extensive evaluations on real-world traffic datasets characterized by dynamic and high-risk scenarios, including highways (HighD), intersections (InD), and roundabouts (RounD), validate the framework's ability to enhance decision-making safety (achieving a 100% safety rate), replicate human-like driving behaviors (with decision alignment exceeding 85%), and adapt effectively to unpredictable scenarios. The proposed framework of SafeDrive establishes a novel paradigm for integrating knowledge- and data-driven methods, highlighting significant potential to improve the safety and adaptability of autonomous driving in long-tail or high-risk traffic scenarios.

[{'authorId': '2355306951', 'name': 'Kaiqing Zhang'}]. AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2025.\nAbstract: Recent years have witnessed tremendous successes of learning for sequential decision-making, and in particular, Reinforcement Learning (RL). Prominent application examples include playing Go and video games, robotics, autonomous driving, and recently large language models. Most such success stories naturally involve \"multi-agents\". Hence, there has been surging research interest in advancing Multi-Agent Learning in Dynamic Environments, particularly, multi-agent RL (MARL), to which my research has led and made significant contributions. My work has established both sample and computational complexities of learning in Stochastic Games, the most fundamental model of MARL, and advocated a unique Economics perspective of independent learning in Stochastic Games. My work has also initiated the recent studies of distributed and networked MARL, with applications in robust adversarial RL, offline RL, and Robotics. This paper will survey my notable contributions along this journey of developing the foundations of multi-agent learning in dynamic environments.\n\n2: HAZARD Challenge: Embodied Decision Making in Dynamically Changing Environments.

International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.\nAbstract: Recent advances in high-fidelity virtual environments serve as one of the major driving forces for building intelligent embodied agents to perceive, reason and interact with the physical world. Typically, these environments remain unchanged unless agents interact with them. However, in real-world scenarios, agents might also face dynamically changing environments characterized by unexpected events and need to rapidly take action accordingly. To remedy this gap, we propose a new simulated embodied benchmark, called HAZARD, specifically designed to assess the decision-making abilities of embodied agents in dynamic situations. HAZARD consists of three unexpected disaster scenarios, including fire, flood, and wind, and specifically supports the utilization of large language models (LLMs) to assist common sense reasoning and decision-making. This benchmark enables us to evaluate autonomous agents' decision-making capabilities across various pipelines, including reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and search-based methods in dynamically changing environments. As a first step toward addressing this challenge using large language models, we further develop an LLM-based agent and perform an in-depth analysis of its promise and challenge of solving these challenging tasks.

Researchers have examined LLMs' decision-making through the lens of Game Theory. However, existing evaluation mainly focus on two-player scenarios where an LLM competes against another. Additionally, previous benchmarks suffer from test set leakage due to their static design. We introduce GAMA($\\gamma$)-Bench, a new framework for evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. It includes eight classical game theory scenarios and a dynamic scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. $\\gamma$-Bench allows flexible game settings and adapts the scoring system to different game parameters, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robustness, generalizability, and strategies for improvement. Our results indicate that GPT-3.5 demonstrates strong robustness but limited generalizability, which can be enhanced using methods like Chain-of-Thought. We also evaluate 13 LLMs from 6 model families, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms others, scoring of $69.8$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B ($65.9$) and Mixtral-8x22B ($62.4$).

These LLMs are not just capable of modeling language, but can also act as intelligent \u201cagents\u201d that interact with stakeholders in open-ended conversations and even influence clinical decision-making. Rather than relying on benchmarks that measure a model\u2019s ability to process clinical data or answer standardized test questions, LLM agents can be modeled in high-fidelity simulations of clinical settings and should be assessed for their impact on clinical workflows. These evaluation frameworks, which we refer to as \u201cArtificial Intelligence Structured Clinical Examinations\u201d (\u201cAI-SCE\u201d), can draw from comparable technologies where machines operate with varying degrees of self-governance, such as self-driving cars, in dynamic environments with multiple stakeholders.

This aligns closely with our focus on using LLMs for decision-making in dynamic environments. The paper can support our discussion on the application of LLMs in real-world dynamic scenarios, highlighting the challenges and opportunities.\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n{\n  \"Selected\": [0],\n  \"Description\": \"The paper 'SafeDrive: Knowledge- and Data-Driven Risk-Sensitive Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Models' by Zhiyuan Zhou et al. explores using LLMs to enhance decision-making in dynamic, high-risk environments, specifically for autonomous vehicles. This work is relevant when discussing the application of LLMs in dynamic scenarios, supporting our hypothesis that LLMs can simulate future scenarios to improve decision-making. It should be cited in sections summarizing existing research and supporting arguments for LLM applications in dynamic environments.\"\n}\n```", "timestamp": 1763863973}]}
