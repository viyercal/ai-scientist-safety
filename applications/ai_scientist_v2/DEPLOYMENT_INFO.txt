Project Slug: safe-ai-scientist
Student Name: Vivek Iyer
Student Email: vivek.iyer@columbia.edu
Main File: app.py (and AI_Scientist_V2_Safety.ipynb)

Environment Variables Needed:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Yes
- OPENAI_BASE_URL: Yes: I used openrouter: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1”
- open_router: Yes

Verified Working Locally: Yes
Verified Working in Docker: Yes

Notes: 
To run the docker container, please run these commands:
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t safe-ai-scientist:latest .  

docker run -p 8501:8501   -e OPENAI_API_KEY="insert_your_key"   safe-ai-scientist:latest

The structure of my project is a bit atypical, without utils/ or agents/ due to the integration with Sakana AI’s codebase. Streamlit still runs locally and via Docker, however.
